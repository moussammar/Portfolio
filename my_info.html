                <h4>About Me</h4>
                <p>Hello! My name is Moussa Ammar, I'm  Life Science student from Homs, Syria, currently
                    residing in Lebanon. I am passionate about learning and constantly seeking opportunities to expand
                    my knowledge and skills, I believe in the power of technology to bring positive
                    change to communities. Alongside my studies at Al Fakiha Official High School, I am actively
                    pursuing web development through CodeBrave, where I am honing my technical abilities. Additionally,
                    I have completed a call center course and volunteered with several charities, focusing on supporting
                    Syrian refugee children and organizing festivals to bring joy to their lives. My diverse interests
                    and commitment to helping others drive my personal and professional growth, and I am excited to
                    continue exploring new opportunities in both technology and community service.
